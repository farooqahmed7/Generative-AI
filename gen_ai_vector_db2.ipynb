Instead, we frame object detection as a re-\\ngression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and\\nassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-\\ndicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from\\nfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection\\npipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end\\ndirectly on detection performance.\\nOur uniﬁed architecture is extremely fast. Our base\\nYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames\\nper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,\\nprocesses an astounding 155 frames per second while\\nstill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-\\ntors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO\\nmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predict\\nfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very\\ngeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-\\ntection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-\\nalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.\\n1. Introduction\\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-\\njects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-\\nact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-\\ning us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-\\nscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-\\ntion would allow computers to drive cars without special-\\nized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time\\nscene information to human users, and unlock the potential\\nfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems.\\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classiﬁers to per-\\nform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a\\nclassiﬁer for that object and evaluate it at various locations\\nand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts\\nmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the\\nclassiﬁer is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire\\nimage [10].\\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\\n1.

Processing images\\nwith YOLO is simple and straightforward. Our system (1) resizes\\nthe input image to 448×448, (2) runs a single convolutional net-\\nwork on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections by\\nthe model’s conﬁdence.\\nmethods to ﬁrst generate potential bounding boxes in an im-\\nage and then run a classiﬁer on these proposed boxes. After\\nclassiﬁcation, post-processing is used to reﬁne the bound-\\ning boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore the\\nboxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com-\\nplex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each\\nindividual component must be trained separately.\\nWe reframe object detection as a single regression prob-\\nlem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-\\nnates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only\\nlook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are\\npresent and where they are.\\nYOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-\\ngle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-\\nple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.\\nYOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-\\ntion performance. This uniﬁed model has several beneﬁts\\nover traditional methods of object detection.\\nFirst, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection\\nas a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline.\\nWe simply run our neural network on a new image at test\\ntime to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45\\nframes per second with no batch processing on a Titan X\\nGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This\\nmeans we can process streaming video in real-time with\\nless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO\\nachieves more than twice the mean average precision of\\nother real-time systems. For a demo of our system running\\nin real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage:\\nhttp://pjreddie.com/yolo/ .\\nSecond, YOLO reasons globally about the image when\\n1arXiv:1506.02640v5  [cs.CV]  9 May 2016', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\yolo.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region\\nproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image\\nduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-\\ntual information about classes as well as their appearance.\\nFast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-\\nground patches in an image for objects because it can’t see\\nthe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number\\nof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-\\njects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-\\nwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM\\nand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-\\neralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to\\nnew domains or unexpected inputs.\\nYOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems\\nin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-\\nages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-\\ncially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our\\nexperiments.\\nAll of our training and testing code is open source. A\\nvariety of pretrained models are also available to download.\\n2. Uniﬁed Detection\\nWe unify the separate components of object detection\\ninto a single neural network. Our network uses features\\nfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also\\npredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-\\nage simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-\\nally about the full image and all the objects in the image.\\nThe YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-\\ntime speeds while maintaining high average precision.\\nOur system divides the input image into an S×Sgrid.\\nIf the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell\\nis responsible for detecting that object.\\nEach grid cell predicts Bbounding boxes and conﬁdence\\nscores for those boxes. These conﬁdence scores reﬂect how\\nconﬁdent the model is that the box contains an object and\\nalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-\\nmally we deﬁne conﬁdence as Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred. If no\\nobject exists in that cell, the conﬁdence scores should be\\nzero. Otherwise we want the conﬁdence score to equal the\\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box\\nand the ground truth.\\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x,y,w,h,\\nand conﬁdence. The (x,y)coordinates represent the center\\nof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width\\nand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally\\nthe conﬁdence prediction represents the IOU between the\\npredicted box and any ground truth box.\\nEach grid cell also predicts Cconditional class proba-\\nbilities, Pr(Classi|Object ). These probabilities are condi-\\ntioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predictone set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the\\nnumber of boxes B.\\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\\nties and the individual box conﬁdence predictions,\\nPr(Classi|Object )∗Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred= Pr( Classi)∗IOUtruth\\npred(1)\\nwhich gives us class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each\\nbox. These scores encode both the probability of that class\\nappearing in the box and how well the predicted box ﬁts the\\nobject.\\nS × S grid on inputBounding boxes + confidence\\nClass probability mapFinal detections\\nFigure 2: The Model.

The full network is\\nshown in Figure 3.\\nWe also train a fast version of YOLO designed to push\\nthe boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses a\\nneural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 instead\\nof 24) and fewer ﬁlters in those layers.

Our detection network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Alternating 1×1\\nconvolutional layers reduce the features space from preceding layers. We pretrain the convolutional layers on the ImageNet classiﬁcation\\ntask at half the resolution ( 224×224input image) and then double the resolution for detection.\\nThe ﬁnal output of our network is the 7×7×30tensor\\nof predictions.\\n2.2. Training\\nWe pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet\\n1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use\\nthe ﬁrst 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a\\naverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train\\nthis network for approximately a week and achieve a single\\ncrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-\\ntion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s\\nModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all\\ntraining and inference [26].\\nWe then convert the model to perform detection. Ren et\\nal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-\\ners to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].\\nFollowing their example, we add four convolutional lay-\\ners and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized\\nweights. Detection often requires ﬁne-grained visual infor-\\nmation so we increase the input resolution of the network\\nfrom 224×224to448×448.\\nOur ﬁnal layer predicts both class probabilities and\\nbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box\\nwidth and height by the image width and height so that they\\nfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x\\nandycoordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-\\ntion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\\nWe use a linear activation function for the ﬁnal layer and\\nall other layers use the following leaky rectiﬁed linear acti-\\nvation:\\nφ(x) ={\\nx, ifx>0\\n0.1x,otherwise(2)\\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of ourmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-\\ntimize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of\\nmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-\\nror equally with classiﬁcation error which may not be ideal.\\nAlso, in every image many grid cells do not contain any\\nobject. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells\\ntowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells\\nthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,\\ncausing training to diverge early on.\\nTo remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding box\\ncoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from conﬁ-\\ndence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. We\\nuse two parameters, λcoordandλnoobjto accomplish this. We\\nsetλcoord= 5andλnoobj=.5.\\nSum-squared error also equally weights errors in large\\nboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reﬂect that\\nsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in small\\nboxes. To partially address this we predict the square root\\nof the bounding box width and height instead of the width\\nand height directly.\\nYOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.\\nAt training time we only want one bounding box predictor\\nto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor\\nto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which\\nprediction has the highest current IOU with the ground\\ntruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box\\npredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain\\nsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall\\nrecall.\\nDuring training we optimize the following, multi-part', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\yolo.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

It also only pe-\\nnalizes bounding box coordinate error if that predictor is\\n“responsible” for the ground truth box (i.e. has the highest\\nIOU of any predictor in that grid cell).\\nWe train the network for about 135 epochs on the train-\\ning and validation data sets from P ASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012. When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007\\ntest data for training. Throughout training we use a batch\\nsize of 64, a momentum of 0.9and a decay of 0.0005 .\\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst\\nepochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10−3to10−2.\\nIf we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges\\ndue to unstable gradients. We continue training with 10−2\\nfor 75 epochs, then 10−3for 30 epochs, and ﬁnally 10−4\\nfor 30 epochs.\\nTo avoid overﬁtting we use dropout and extensive data\\naugmentation. A dropout layer with rate = .5 after the ﬁrst\\nconnected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers [18].\\nFor data augmentation we introduce random scaling and\\ntranslations of up to 20% of the original image size. We\\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\\nage by up to a factor of 1.5in the HSV color space.\\n2.3. Inference\\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\\nonly requires one network evaluation. On P ASCAL VOC the\\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\\nlike classiﬁer-based methods.\\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box for\\neach object. However, some large objects or objects nearthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these\\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\\n3% in mAP.\\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\\nand can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim-\\nits the number of nearby objects that our model can pre-\\ndict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in\\ngroups, such as ﬂocks of birds.\\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from\\ndata, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual\\naspect ratios or conﬁgurations. Our model also uses rela-\\ntively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since\\nour architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the\\ninput image.\\nFinally, while we train on a loss function that approxi-\\nmates detection performance, our loss function treats errors\\nthe same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding\\nboxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a\\nsmall error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.\\nOur main source of error is incorrect localizations.\\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision.\\nDetection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of\\nrobust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23],\\nHOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classiﬁers\\n[36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify\\nobjects in the feature space. These classiﬁers or localizers\\nare run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im-\\nage or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39].\\nWe compare the YOLO detection system to several top de-\\ntection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ-\\nences.\\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models\\n(DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection\\n[10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features,\\nclassify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring\\nregions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts\\nwith a single convolutional neural network. The network\\nperforms feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non-\\nmaximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur-\\nrently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea-\\ntures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our\\nuniﬁed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model\\nthan DPM.\\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in-\\nstead of sliding windows to ﬁnd objects in images.

       " Document(page_content='Search [35] generates potential bounding boxes, a convolu-\\ntional network extracts features, an SVM scores the boxes, a\\nlinear model adjusts the bounding boxes, and non-max sup-\\npression eliminates duplicate detections. Each stage of this\\ncomplex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently\\nand the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40\\nseconds per image at test time [14].\\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid\\ncell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those\\nboxes using convolutional features. However, our system\\nputs spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which\\nhelps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our\\nsystem also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98\\nper image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search.\\nFinally, our system combines these individual components\\ninto a single, jointly optimized model.\\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on\\nspeeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa-\\ntion and using neural networks to propose regions instead\\nof Selective Search [14] [28]. While they offer speed and\\naccuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of\\nreal-time performance.\\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM\\npipeline [31] [38] [5]. They speed up HOG computation,\\nuse cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However,\\nonly 30Hz DPM [31] actually runs in real-time.\\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of\\na large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline\\nentirely and is fast by design.\\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be\\nhighly optimized since they have to deal with much less\\nvariation [37]. YOLO is a general purpose detector that\\nlearns to detect a variety of objects simultaneously.\\nDeep MultiBox. Unlike R-CNN, Szegedy et al. train a\\nconvolutional neural network to predict regions of interest\\n[8] instead of using Selective Search. MultiBox can also\\nperform single object detection by replacing the conﬁdence\\nprediction with a single class prediction. However, Multi-\\nBox cannot perform general object detection and is still just\\na piece in a larger detection pipeline, requiring further im-\\nage patch classiﬁcation. Both YOLO and MultiBox use a\\nconvolutional network to predict bounding boxes in an im-\\nage but YOLO is a complete detection system.\\nOverFeat. Sermanet et al. train a convolutional neural\\nnetwork to perform localization and adapt that localizer to\\nperform detection [32]. OverFeat efﬁciently performs slid-\\ning window detection but it is still a disjoint system. Over-\\nFeat optimizes for localization, not detection performance.\\nLike DPM, the localizer only sees local information when\\nmaking a prediction. OverFeat cannot reason about global\\ncontext and thus requires signiﬁcant post-processing to pro-\\nduce coherent detections.\\nMultiGrasp. Our work is similar in design to work ongrasp detection by Redmon et al [27]. Our grid approach to\\nbounding box prediction is based on the MultiGrasp system\\nfor regression to grasps. However, grasp detection is a much\\nsimpler task than object detection. MultiGrasp only needs\\nto predict a single graspable region for an image containing\\none object. It doesn’t have to estimate the size, location,\\nor boundaries of the object or predict it’s class, only ﬁnd a\\nregion suitable for grasping. YOLO predicts both bounding\\nboxes and class probabilities for multiple objects of multi-\\nple classes in an image.\\n4. Experiments\\nFirst we compare YOLO with other real-time detection\\nsystems on P ASCAL VOC 2007. To understand the differ-\\nences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the\\nerrors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one\\nof the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based\\non the different error proﬁles we show that YOLO can be\\nused to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er-\\nrors from background false positives, giving a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and\\ncompare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally,\\nwe show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than\\nother detectors on two artwork datasets.\\n4.1. Comparison to Other Real-Time Systems\\nMany research efforts in object detection focus on mak-\\ning standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17]\\n[28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a de-\\ntection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second\\nor better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU imple-\\nmentation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz.\\nWhile the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone\\nwe also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine\\nthe accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object de-\\ntection systems.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on\\nPASCAL ; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object\\ndetector. With 52.7%mAP, it is more than twice as accurate\\nas prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes mAP to\\n63.4%while still maintaining real-time performance.\\nWe also train YOLO using VGG-16.

Fast R-CNN makes much fewer local-\\nization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of\\nit’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any\\nobjects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict\\nbackground detections than YOLO.\\n4.3. Combining Fast R-CNN and YOLO\\nYOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast\\nR-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detec-\\ntions from Fast R-CNN we get a signiﬁcant boost in perfor-\\nmance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we\\ncheck to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we\\ngive that prediction a boost based on the probability pre-\\ndicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes.\\nThe best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%\\non the VOC 2007 test set.

YOLO compared with the full comp4 (outside data allowed) public leaderboard as of\\nNovember 6th, 2015. Mean average precision and per-class average precision are shown for a variety of detection methods. YOLO is the\\nonly real-time detector. Fast R-CNN + YOLO is the forth highest scoring method, with a 2.3% boost over Fast R-CNN.\\nmAP increases by 3.2% to 75.0%. We also tried combining\\nthe top Fast R-CNN model with several other versions of\\nFast R-CNN. Those ensembles produced small increases in\\nmAP between .3 and .6%, see Table 2 for details.\\nThe boost from YOLO is not simply a byproduct of\\nmodel ensembling since there is little beneﬁt from combin-\\ning different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is precisely\\nbecause YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at test\\ntime that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s per-\\nformance.\\nUnfortunately, this combination doesn’t beneﬁt from the\\nspeed of YOLO since we run each model seperately and\\nthen combine the results. However, since YOLO is so fast\\nit doesn’t add any signiﬁcant computational time compared\\nto Fast R-CNN.\\n4.4. VOC 2012 Results\\nOn the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP.\\nThis is lower than the current state of the art, closer to\\nthe original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our sys-\\ntem struggles with small objects compared to its closest\\ncompetitors. On categories like bottle ,sheep , and\\ntv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or\\nFeature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and\\ntrain YOLO achieves higher performance.\\nOur combined Fast R-CNN + YOLO model is one of the\\nhighest performing detection methods. Fast R-CNN gets\\na 2.3% improvement from the combination with YOLO,\\nboosting it 5 spots up on the public leaderboard.\\n4.5. Generalizability: Person Detection in Artwork\\nAcademic datasets for object detection draw the training\\nand testing data from the same distribution. In real-world\\napplications it is hard to predict all possible use cases andthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be-\\nfore [3]. We compare YOLO to other detection systems on\\nthe Picasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], two\\ndatasets for testing person detection on artwork.\\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between\\nYOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give\\nVOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are\\ntrained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are\\ntrained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained\\non VOC 2010.\\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN\\ndrops off considerably when applied to artwork. R-CNN\\nuses Selective Search for bounding box proposals which is\\ntuned for natural images. The classiﬁer step in R-CNN only\\nsees small regions and needs good proposals.\\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork.\\nPrior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has\\nstrong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects.\\nThough DPM doesn’t degrade as much as R-CNN, it starts\\nfrom a lower AP.\\nYOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP\\ndegrades less than other methods when applied to artwork.\\nLike DPM, YOLO models the size and shape of objects,\\nas well as relationships between objects and where objects\\ncommonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very\\ndifferent on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of\\nthe size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict\\ngood bounding boxes and detections.\\n5.

Our model is simple to construct and can be traineddirectly on full images. Unlike classiﬁer-based approaches,\\nYOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds\\nto detection performance and the entire model is trained\\njointly.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec-\\ntor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in\\nreal-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to\\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\\nfast, robust object detection.\\nAcknowledgements: This work is partially supported by\\nONR N00014-13-1-0720, NSF IIS-1338054, and The Allen\\nDistinguished Investigator Award.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\yolo.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Prior work on object detection repurposes classiﬁers to per- form detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a re- gression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network pre- dicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.\\n\\n1. Resize image.2. Run convolutional network.3. Non-max suppression.

Our system (1) resizes the input image to 448 × 448, (2) runs a single convolutional net- work on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections by the model’s conﬁdence.\\n\\nOur uniﬁed architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec- tors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other de- tection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener- alizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.\\n\\nmethods to ﬁrst generate potential bounding boxes in an im- age and then run a classiﬁer on these proposed boxes. After classiﬁcation, post-processing is used to reﬁne the bound- ing boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore the boxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com- plex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each individual component must be trained separately.\\n\\nWe reframe object detection as a single regression prob- lem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi- nates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are present and where they are.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob- jects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter- act. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow- ing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con- scious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec- tion would allow computers to drive cars without special- ized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time scene information to human users, and unlock the potential for general purpose, responsive robotic systems.\\n\\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classiﬁers to per- form detection. To detect an object, these systems take a classiﬁer for that object and evaluate it at various locations and scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the classiﬁer is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image [10].\\n\\nYOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin- gle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi- ple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec- tion performance. This uniﬁed model has several beneﬁts over traditional methods of object detection.\\n\\nFirst, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection as a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45 frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This means we can process streaming video in real-time with less than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO achieves more than twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems. For a demo of our system running in real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage: http://pjreddie.com/yolo/.\\n\\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\\n\\nSecond, YOLO reasons globally about the image when\\n\\n1\\n\\nmaking predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex- tual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back- ground patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\\n\\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob- jects. When trained on natural images and tested on art- work, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen- eralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected inputs.\\n\\nYOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im- ages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe- cially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments.\\n\\nAll of our training and testing code is open source. A variety of pretrained models are also available to download.\\n\\n2. Uniﬁed Detection\\n\\nWe unify the separate components of object detection into a single neural network. Our network uses features from the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also predicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im- age simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob- ally about the full image and all the objects in the image. The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real- time speeds while maintaining high average precision.\\n\\nOur system divides the input image into an S × S grid. If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.\\n\\nEach grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and conﬁdence scores for those boxes. These conﬁdence scores reﬂect how conﬁdent the model is that the box contains an object and also how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For- mally we deﬁne conﬁdence as Pr(Object) ∗ IOUtruth pred . If no object exists in that cell, the conﬁdence scores should be zero. Otherwise we want the conﬁdence score to equal the intersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box and the ground truth.\\n\\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x, y, w, h, and conﬁdence. The (x, y) coordinates represent the center of the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width and height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally the conﬁdence prediction represents the IOU between the predicted box and any ground truth box.\\n\\nEach grid cell also predicts C conditional class proba- bilities, Pr(Classi|Object). These probabilities are condi- tioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predict\\n\\none set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the number of boxes B.\\n\\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\\n\\nties and the individual box conﬁdence predictions,\\n\\nPr(Classi|Object) ∗ Pr(Object) ∗ IOU\\n\\ntruth pred = Pr(Classi) ∗ IOU\\n\\ntruth pred\\n\\nwhich gives us class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box. These scores encode both the probability of that class appearing in the box and how well the predicted box ﬁts the object.\\n\\nS × S grid on inputBounding boxes + confidenceClass probability mapFinal detections\\n\\nFigure 2: The Model. Our system models detection as a regres- sion problem. It divides the image into an S × S grid and for each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes, conﬁdence for those boxes, and C class probabilities. These predictions are encoded as an S × S × (B ∗ 5 + C) tensor.\\n\\nFor evaluating YOLO on PASCAL VOC, we use S = 7, B = 2. PASCAL VOC has 20 labelled classes so C = 20. Our ﬁnal prediction is a 7 × 7 × 30 tensor.\\n\\n2.1. Network Design\\n\\nWe implement this model as a convolutional neural net- work and evaluate it on the PASCAL VOC detection dataset [9]. The initial convolutional layers of the network extract features from the image while the fully connected layers predict the output probabilities and coordinates.\\n\\nOur network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNet model for image classiﬁcation [34]. Our network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, we simply use 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 convo- lutional layers, similar to Lin et al [22]. The full network is shown in Figure 3.\\n\\nWe also train a fast version of YOLO designed to push the boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses a neural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 instead of 24) and fewer ﬁlters in those layers. Other than the size of the network, all training and testing parameters are the same between YOLO and Fast YOLO.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n33\\n\\n771024\\n\\n77Conv.

Our detection network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Alternating 1 × 1 convolutional layers reduce the features space from preceding layers. We pretrain the convolutional layers on the ImageNet classiﬁcation task at half the resolution (224 × 224 input image) and then double the resolution for detection.\\n\\nThe ﬁnal output of our network is the 7 × 7 × 30 tensor\\n\\nof predictions.\\n\\n2.2. Training\\n\\nWe pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use the ﬁrst 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a average-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train this network for approximately a week and achieve a single crop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida- tion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s Model Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all training and inference [26].\\n\\nWe then convert the model to perform detection. Ren et al. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay- ers to pretrained networks can improve performance [29]. Following their example, we add four convolutional lay- ers and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized weights. Detection often requires ﬁne-grained visual infor- mation so we increase the input resolution of the network from 224 × 224 to 448 × 448.\\n\\nOur ﬁnal layer predicts both class probabilities and bounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box width and height by the image width and height so that they fall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x and y coordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca- tion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\\n\\nWe use a linear activation function for the ﬁnal layer and all other layers use the following leaky rectiﬁed linear acti- vation:\\n\\nφ(x) =\\n\\n(cid:40)\\n\\nx, 0.1x,\\n\\nif x > 0 otherwise\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op- timize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of maximizing average precision. It weights localization er- ror equally with classiﬁcation error which may not be ideal. Also, in every image many grid cells do not contain any object. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells towards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells that do contain objects. This can lead to model instability, causing training to diverge early on.\\n\\nTo remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding box coordinate predictions and decrease the loss from conﬁ- dence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. We use two parameters, λcoord and λnoobj to accomplish this. We set λcoord = 5 and λnoobj = .5.\\n\\nSum-squared error also equally weights errors in large boxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reﬂect that small deviations in large boxes matter less than in small boxes. To partially address this we predict the square root of the bounding box width and height instead of the width and height directly.\\n\\nYOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell. At training time we only want one bounding box predictor to be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor to be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which prediction has the highest current IOU with the ground truth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box predictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain sizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall recall.\\n\\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of our\\n\\nDuring training we optimize the following, multi-part\\n\\nloss function:\\n\\nλcoord\\n\\nS2 (cid:88)\\n\\nB (cid:88)\\n\\n1obj ij\\n\\n(xi − ˆxi)2 + (yi − ˆyi)2(cid:105) (cid:104)\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\n+ λcoord\\n\\nS2 (cid:88)\\n\\nB (cid:88)\\n\\n1obj ij\\n\\n(cid:20)(cid:16)√\\n\\nwi −\\n\\n(cid:112)\\n\\nˆwi\\n\\n(cid:17)2\\n\\n+\\n\\n(cid:18)(cid:112)\\n\\nhi −\\n\\n(cid:113)\\n\\nˆhi\\n\\n(cid:19)2(cid:21)\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\n+\\n\\nS2 (cid:88)\\n\\nB (cid:88)\\n\\n1obj ij\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\nCi − ˆCi\\n\\n(cid:17)2\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\n+ λnoobj\\n\\nS2 (cid:88)\\n\\nB (cid:88)\\n\\n1noobj ij\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\nCi − ˆCi\\n\\n(cid:17)2\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\n+\\n\\nS2 (cid:88)\\n\\n1obj i\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\n(pi(c) − ˆpi(c))2\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nc∈classes\\n\\nwhere 1obj ij de- i notes that the jth bounding box predictor in cell i is “re- sponsible” for that prediction.\\n\\ndenotes if object appears in cell i and 1obj\\n\\nNote that the loss function only penalizes classiﬁcation error if an object is present in that grid cell (hence the con- ditional class probability discussed earlier). It also only pe- nalizes bounding box coordinate error if that predictor is “responsible” for the ground truth box (i.e. has the highest IOU of any predictor in that grid cell).\\n\\nWe train the network for about 135 epochs on the train- ing and validation data sets from PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007 test data for training. Throughout training we use a batch size of 64, a momentum of 0.9 and a decay of 0.0005.\\n\\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst epochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10−3 to 10−2. If we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges due to unstable gradients. We continue training with 10−2 for 75 epochs, then 10−3 for 30 epochs, and ﬁnally 10−4 for 30 epochs.\\n\\nTo avoid overﬁtting we use dropout and extensive data augmentation. A dropout layer with rate = .5 after the ﬁrst connected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers [18]. For data augmentation we introduce random scaling and translations of up to 20% of the original image size. We also randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im- age by up to a factor of 1.5 in the HSV color space.\\n\\n2.3. Inference\\n\\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image only requires one network evaluation. On PASCAL VOC the network predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class probabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test time since it only requires a single network evaluation, un- like classiﬁer-based methods.\\n\\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound- ing box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an object falls in to and the network only predicts one box for each object. However, some large objects or objects near\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi- ple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these multiple detections. While not critical to performance as it is for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2- 3% in mAP.\\n\\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\\n\\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim- its the number of nearby objects that our model can pre- dict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as ﬂocks of birds.\\n\\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or conﬁgurations. Our model also uses rela- tively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since our architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the input image.\\n\\nFinally, while we train on a loss function that approxi- mates detection performance, our loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU. Our main source of error is incorrect localizations.\\n\\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\\n\\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision. Detection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of robust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23], HOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classiﬁers [36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify objects in the feature space. These classiﬁers or localizers are run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im- age or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39]. We compare the YOLO detection system to several top de- tection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ- ences.\\n\\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection [10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features, classify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring regions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts with a single convolutional neural network. The network performs feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non- maximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur- rently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea- tures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our uniﬁed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model than DPM.\\n\\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in- stead of sliding windows to ﬁnd objects in images. Selective\\n\\nSearch [35] generates potential bounding boxes, a convolu- tional network extracts features, an SVM scores the boxes, a linear model adjusts the bounding boxes, and non-max sup- pression eliminates duplicate detections. Each stage of this complex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently and the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40 seconds per image at test time [14].\\n\\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid cell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those boxes using convolutional features. However, our system puts spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which helps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our system also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98 per image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search. Finally, our system combines these individual components into a single, jointly optimized model.\\n\\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on speeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa- tion and using neural networks to propose regions instead of Selective Search [14] [28]. While they offer speed and accuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of real-time performance.\\n\\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM pipeline [31] [38] [5]. They speed up HOG computation, use cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However, only 30Hz DPM [31] actually runs in real-time.\\n\\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of a large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline entirely and is fast by design.\\n\\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be highly optimized since they have to deal with much less variation [37]. YOLO is a general purpose detector that learns to detect a variety of objects simultaneously.\\n\\nDeep MultiBox. Unlike R-CNN, Szegedy et al. train a convolutional neural network to predict regions of interest [8] instead of using Selective Search. MultiBox can also perform single object detection by replacing the conﬁdence prediction with a single class prediction. However, Multi- Box cannot perform general object detection and is still just a piece in a larger detection pipeline, requiring further im- age patch classiﬁcation. Both YOLO and MultiBox use a convolutional network to predict bounding boxes in an im- age but YOLO is a complete detection system.\\n\\nOverFeat. Sermanet et al. train a convolutional neural network to perform localization and adapt that localizer to perform detection [32]. OverFeat efﬁciently performs slid- ing window detection but it is still a disjoint system. Over- Feat optimizes for localization, not detection performance. Like DPM, the localizer only sees local information when making a prediction. OverFeat cannot reason about global context and thus requires signiﬁcant post-processing to pro- duce coherent detections.\\n\\nMultiGrasp. Our work is similar in design to work on\\n\\ngrasp detection by Redmon et al [27]. Our grid approach to bounding box prediction is based on the MultiGrasp system for regression to grasps. However, grasp detection is a much simpler task than object detection. MultiGrasp only needs to predict a single graspable region for an image containing one object. It doesn’t have to estimate the size, location, or boundaries of the object or predict it’s class, only ﬁnd a region suitable for grasping. YOLO predicts both bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects of multi- ple classes in an image.\\n\\n4. Experiments\\n\\nFirst we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on PASCAL VOC 2007. To understand the differ- ences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error proﬁles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er- rors from background false positives, giving a signiﬁcant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets.\\n\\n4.1. Comparison to Other Real-Time Systems\\n\\nMany research efforts in object detection focus on mak- ing standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17] [28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a de- tection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second or better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU imple- mentation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz. While the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone we also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine the accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object de- tection systems.\\n\\nFast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on PASCAL; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object detector. With 52.7% mAP, it is more than twice as accurate as prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes mAP to 63.4% while still maintaining real-time performance.\\n\\nWe also train YOLO using VGG-16. This model is more accurate but also signiﬁcantly slower than YOLO. It is use- ful for comparison to other detection systems that rely on VGG-16 but since it is slower than real-time the rest of the paper focuses on our faster models.\\n\\nFastest DPM effectively speeds up DPM without sacri- ﬁcing much mAP but it still misses real-time performance by a factor of 2 [38]. It also is limited by DPM’s relatively low accuracy on detection compared to neural network ap- proaches.\\n\\nR-CNN minus R replaces Selective Search with static bounding box proposals [20]. While it is much faster than\\n\\nReal-Time Detectors 100Hz DPM [31] 30Hz DPM [31] Fast YOLO YOLO Less Than Real-Time Fastest DPM [38] R-CNN Minus R [20] Fast R-CNN [14] Faster R-CNN VGG-16[28] Faster R-CNN ZF [28] YOLO VGG-16\\n\\nTrain mAP 16.0 2007 26.1 2007 52.7 2007+2012 63.4 2007+2012\\n\\n2007 2007 2007+2012 2007+2012 2007+2012 2007+2012\\n\\n30.4 53.5 70.0 73.2 62.1 66.4\\n\\nTable 1: Real-Time Systems on PASCAL VOC 2007. Compar- ing the performance and speed of fast detectors. Fast YOLO is the fastest detector on record for PASCAL VOC detection and is still twice as accurate as any other real-time detector. YOLO is 10 mAP more accurate than the fast version while still well above real-time in speed.\\n\\nR-CNN, it still falls short of real-time and takes a signiﬁcant accuracy hit from not having good proposals.\\n\\nFast R-CNN speeds up the classiﬁcation stage of R-CNN but it still relies on selective search which can take around 2 seconds per image to generate bounding box proposals. Thus it has high mAP but at 0.5 fps it is still far from real- time.\\n\\nThe recent Faster R-CNN replaces selective search with a neural network to propose bounding boxes, similar to Szegedy et al. [8] In our tests, their most accurate model achieves 7 fps while a smaller, less accurate one runs at 18 fps. The VGG-16 version of Faster R-CNN is 10 mAP higher but is also 6 times slower than YOLO. The Zeiler- Fergus Faster R-CNN is only 2.5 times slower than YOLO but is also less accurate.\\n\\n4.2. VOC 2007 Error Analysis\\n\\nTo further examine the differences between YOLO and state-of-the-art detectors, we look at a detailed breakdown of results on VOC 2007. We compare YOLO to Fast R- CNN since Fast R-CNN is one of the highest performing detectors on PASCAL and it’s detections are publicly avail- able.\\n\\nWe use the methodology and tools of Hoiem et al. [19] For each category at test time we look at the top N predic- tions for that category. Each prediction is either correct or it is classiﬁed based on the type of error:\\n\\nCorrect: correct class and IOU > .5\\n\\nLocalization: correct class, .1 < IOU < .5\\n\\nSimilar: class is similar, IOU > .1\\n\\nFPS 100 30 155 45\\n\\n15 6 0.5 7 18 21\\n\\nCorrect: 71.6%Correct: 65.5%Loc: 8.6%Sim: 4.3%Other: 1.9%Background: 13.6%Loc: 19.0%Sim: 6.75%Other: 4.0%Background: 4.75%Fast R-CNNYOLO\\n\\nFigure 4: Error Analysis: Fast R-CNN vs. YOLO These charts show the percentage of localization and background errors in the top N detections for various categories (N = # objects in that category).\\n\\nOther: class is wrong, IOU > .1\\n\\nBackground: IOU < .1 for any object\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the breakdown of each error type aver-\\n\\naged across all 20 classes.\\n\\nYOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localiza- tion errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other sources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer local- ization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO.\\n\\n4.3. Combining Fast R-CNN and YOLO\\n\\nYOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast R-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detec- tions from Fast R-CNN we get a signiﬁcant boost in perfor- mance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we check to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we give that prediction a boost based on the probability pre- dicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes.\\n\\nThe best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8% on the VOC 2007 test set. When combined with YOLO, its\\n\\nFast R-CNN Fast R-CNN (2007 data) Fast R-CNN (VGG-M) Fast R-CNN (CaffeNet) YOLO\\n\\nmAP Combined Gain - 71.8 66.9 .6 .6 59.2 .3 57.1 3.2 63.4\\n\\n72.4 72.4 72.1 75.0\\n\\nTable 2: Model combination experiments on VOC 2007.

YOLO compared with the full comp4 (outside data allowed) public leaderboard as of November 6th, 2015. Mean average precision and per-class average precision are shown for a variety of detection methods. YOLO is the only real-time detector. Fast R-CNN + YOLO is the forth highest scoring method, with a 2.3% boost over Fast R-CNN.\\n\\nmAP increases by 3.2% to 75.0%. We also tried combining the top Fast R-CNN model with several other versions of Fast R-CNN. Those ensembles produced small increases in mAP between .3 and .6%, see Table 2 for details.\\n\\nthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be- fore [3]. We compare YOLO to other detection systems on the Picasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], two datasets for testing person detection on artwork.\\n\\nThe boost from YOLO is not simply a byproduct of model ensembling since there is little beneﬁt from combin- ing different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is precisely because YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at test time that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s per- formance.\\n\\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between YOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give VOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are trained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are trained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained on VOC 2010.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this combination doesn’t beneﬁt from the speed of YOLO since we run each model seperately and then combine the results. However, since YOLO is so fast it doesn’t add any signiﬁcant computational time compared to Fast R-CNN.\\n\\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN drops off considerably when applied to artwork. R-CNN uses Selective Search for bounding box proposals which is tuned for natural images. The classiﬁer step in R-CNN only sees small regions and needs good proposals.\\n\\n4.4. VOC 2012 Results\\n\\nOn the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our sys- tem struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance.\\n\\nOur combined Fast R-CNN + YOLO model is one of the highest performing detection methods. Fast R-CNN gets a 2.3% improvement from the combination with YOLO, boosting it 5 spots up on the public leaderboard.\\n\\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork. Prior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has strong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects. Though DPM doesn’t degrade as much as R-CNN, it starts from a lower AP.\\n\\nYOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP degrades less than other methods when applied to artwork. Like DPM, YOLO models the size and shape of objects, as well as relationships between objects and where objects commonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very different on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of the size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict good bounding boxes and detections.\\n\\n4.5.

Instead, we frame object detection as a re-\\ngression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and\\nassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-\\ndicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from\\nfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection\\npipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end\\ndirectly on detection performance.\\nOur uniﬁed architecture is extremely fast. Our base\\nYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames\\nper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,\\nprocesses an astounding 155 frames per second while\\nstill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-\\ntors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO\\nmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predict\\nfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very\\ngeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-\\ntection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-\\nalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.\\n1. Introduction\\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-\\njects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-\\nact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-\\ning us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-\\nscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-\\ntion would allow computers to drive cars without special-\\nized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time\\nscene information to human users, and unlock the potential\\nfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems.\\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classiﬁers to per-\\nform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a\\nclassiﬁer for that object and evaluate it at various locations\\nand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts\\nmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the\\nclassiﬁer is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire\\nimage [10].\\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\\n1.

Processing images\\nwith YOLO is simple and straightforward. Our system (1) resizes\\nthe input image to 448×448, (2) runs a single convolutional net-\\nwork on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections by\\nthe model’s conﬁdence.\\nmethods to ﬁrst generate potential bounding boxes in an im-\\nage and then run a classiﬁer on these proposed boxes. After\\nclassiﬁcation, post-processing is used to reﬁne the bound-\\ning boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore the\\nboxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com-\\nplex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each\\nindividual component must be trained separately.\\nWe reframe object detection as a single regression prob-\\nlem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-\\nnates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only\\nlook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are\\npresent and where they are.\\nYOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-\\ngle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-\\nple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.\\nYOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-\\ntion performance. This uniﬁed model has several beneﬁts\\nover traditional methods of object detection.\\nFirst, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection\\nas a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline.\\nWe simply run our neural network on a new image at test\\ntime to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45\\nframes per second with no batch processing on a Titan X\\nGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This\\nmeans we can process streaming video in real-time with\\nless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO\\nachieves more than twice the mean average precision of\\nother real-time systems. For a demo of our system running\\nin real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage:\\nhttp://pjreddie.com/yolo/ .\\nSecond, YOLO reasons globally about the image when\\n1arXiv:1506.02640v5  [cs.CV]  9 May 2016', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\yolo.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region\\nproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image\\nduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-\\ntual information about classes as well as their appearance.\\nFast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-\\nground patches in an image for objects because it can’t see\\nthe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number\\nof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-\\njects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-\\nwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM\\nand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-\\neralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to\\nnew domains or unexpected inputs.\\nYOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems\\nin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-\\nages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-\\ncially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our\\nexperiments.\\nAll of our training and testing code is open source. A\\nvariety of pretrained models are also available to download.\\n2. Uniﬁed Detection\\nWe unify the separate components of object detection\\ninto a single neural network. Our network uses features\\nfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also\\npredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-\\nage simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-\\nally about the full image and all the objects in the image.\\nThe YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-\\ntime speeds while maintaining high average precision.\\nOur system divides the input image into an S×Sgrid.\\nIf the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell\\nis responsible for detecting that object.\\nEach grid cell predicts Bbounding boxes and conﬁdence\\nscores for those boxes. These conﬁdence scores reﬂect how\\nconﬁdent the model is that the box contains an object and\\nalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-\\nmally we deﬁne conﬁdence as Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred. If no\\nobject exists in that cell, the conﬁdence scores should be\\nzero. Otherwise we want the conﬁdence score to equal the\\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box\\nand the ground truth.\\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x,y,w,h,\\nand conﬁdence. The (x,y)coordinates represent the center\\nof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width\\nand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally\\nthe conﬁdence prediction represents the IOU between the\\npredicted box and any ground truth box.\\nEach grid cell also predicts Cconditional class proba-\\nbilities, Pr(Classi|Object ). These probabilities are condi-\\ntioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predictone set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the\\nnumber of boxes B.\\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\\nties and the individual box conﬁdence predictions,\\nPr(Classi|Object )∗Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred= Pr( Classi)∗IOUtruth\\npred(1)\\nwhich gives us class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each\\nbox.

The full network is\\nshown in Figure 3.\\nWe also train a fast version of YOLO designed to push\\nthe boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses a\\nneural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 instead\\nof 24) and fewer ﬁlters in those layers.

Training\\nWe pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet\\n1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use\\nthe ﬁrst 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a\\naverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train\\nthis network for approximately a week and achieve a single\\ncrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-\\ntion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s\\nModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all\\ntraining and inference [26].\\nWe then convert the model to perform detection. Ren et\\nal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-\\ners to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].\\nFollowing their example, we add four convolutional lay-\\ners and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized\\nweights. Detection often requires ﬁne-grained visual infor-\\nmation so we increase the input resolution of the network\\nfrom 224×224to448×448.\\nOur ﬁnal layer predicts both class probabilities and\\nbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box\\nwidth and height by the image width and height so that they\\nfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x\\nandycoordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-\\ntion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\\nWe use a linear activation function for the ﬁnal layer and\\nall other layers use the following leaky rectiﬁed linear acti-\\nvation:\\nφ(x) ={\\nx, ifx>0\\n0.1x,otherwise(2)\\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of ourmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-\\ntimize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of\\nmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-\\nror equally with classiﬁcation error which may not be ideal.\\nAlso, in every image many grid cells do not contain any\\nobject. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells\\ntowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells\\nthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,\\ncausing training to diverge early on.\\nTo remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding box\\ncoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from conﬁ-\\ndence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. We\\nuse two parameters, λcoordandλnoobjto accomplish this. We\\nsetλcoord= 5andλnoobj=.5.\\nSum-squared error also equally weights errors in large\\nboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reﬂect that\\nsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in small\\nboxes. To partially address this we predict the square root\\nof the bounding box width and height instead of the width\\nand height directly.\\nYOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.\\nAt training time we only want one bounding box predictor\\nto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor\\nto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which\\nprediction has the highest current IOU with the ground\\ntruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box\\npredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain\\nsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall\\nrecall.\\nDuring training we optimize the following, multi-part', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\yolo.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

It also only pe-\\nnalizes bounding box coordinate error if that predictor is\\n“responsible” for the ground truth box (i.e. has the highest\\nIOU of any predictor in that grid cell).\\nWe train the network for about 135 epochs on the train-\\ning and validation data sets from P ASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012. When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007\\ntest data for training. Throughout training we use a batch\\nsize of 64, a momentum of 0.9and a decay of 0.0005 .\\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst\\nepochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10−3to10−2.\\nIf we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges\\ndue to unstable gradients. We continue training with 10−2\\nfor 75 epochs, then 10−3for 30 epochs, and ﬁnally 10−4\\nfor 30 epochs.\\nTo avoid overﬁtting we use dropout and extensive data\\naugmentation. A dropout layer with rate = .5 after the ﬁrst\\nconnected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers [18].\\nFor data augmentation we introduce random scaling and\\ntranslations of up to 20% of the original image size. We\\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\\nage by up to a factor of 1.5in the HSV color space.\\n2.3. Inference\\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\\nonly requires one network evaluation. On P ASCAL VOC the\\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\\nlike classiﬁer-based methods.\\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box for\\neach object. However, some large objects or objects nearthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these\\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\\n3% in mAP.\\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\\nand can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim-\\nits the number of nearby objects that our model can pre-\\ndict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in\\ngroups, such as ﬂocks of birds.\\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from\\ndata, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual\\naspect ratios or conﬁgurations. Our model also uses rela-\\ntively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since\\nour architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the\\ninput image.\\nFinally, while we train on a loss function that approxi-\\nmates detection performance, our loss function treats errors\\nthe same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding\\nboxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a\\nsmall error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.\\nOur main source of error is incorrect localizations.\\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision.\\nDetection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of\\nrobust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23],\\nHOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classiﬁers\\n[36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify\\nobjects in the feature space. These classiﬁers or localizers\\nare run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im-\\nage or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39].\\nWe compare the YOLO detection system to several top de-\\ntection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ-\\nences.\\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models\\n(DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection\\n[10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features,\\nclassify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring\\nregions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts\\nwith a single convolutional neural network. The network\\nperforms feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non-\\nmaximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur-\\nrently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea-\\ntures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our\\nuniﬁed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model\\nthan DPM.\\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in-\\nstead of sliding windows to ﬁnd objects in images.

       " Document(page_content='Search [35] generates potential bounding boxes, a convolu-\\ntional network extracts features, an SVM scores the boxes, a\\nlinear model adjusts the bounding boxes, and non-max sup-\\npression eliminates duplicate detections. Each stage of this\\ncomplex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently\\nand the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40\\nseconds per image at test time [14].\\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid\\ncell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those\\nboxes using convolutional features. However, our system\\nputs spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which\\nhelps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our\\nsystem also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98\\nper image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search.\\nFinally, our system combines these individual components\\ninto a single, jointly optimized model.\\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on\\nspeeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa-\\ntion and using neural networks to propose regions instead\\nof Selective Search [14] [28]. While they offer speed and\\naccuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of\\nreal-time performance.\\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM\\npipeline [31] [38] [5]. They speed up HOG computation,\\nuse cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However,\\nonly 30Hz DPM [31] actually runs in real-time.\\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of\\na large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline\\nentirely and is fast by design.\\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be\\nhighly optimized since they have to deal with much less\\nvariation [37]. YOLO is a general purpose detector that\\nlearns to detect a variety of objects simultaneously.\\nDeep MultiBox. Unlike R-CNN, Szegedy et al. train a\\nconvolutional neural network to predict regions of interest\\n[8] instead of using Selective Search. MultiBox can also\\nperform single object detection by replacing the conﬁdence\\nprediction with a single class prediction. However, Multi-\\nBox cannot perform general object detection and is still just\\na piece in a larger detection pipeline, requiring further im-\\nage patch classiﬁcation. Both YOLO and MultiBox use a\\nconvolutional network to predict bounding boxes in an im-\\nage but YOLO is a complete detection system.\\nOverFeat. Sermanet et al. train a convolutional neural\\nnetwork to perform localization and adapt that localizer to\\nperform detection [32]. OverFeat efﬁciently performs slid-\\ning window detection but it is still a disjoint system. Over-\\nFeat optimizes for localization, not detection performance.\\nLike DPM, the localizer only sees local information when\\nmaking a prediction. OverFeat cannot reason about global\\ncontext and thus requires signiﬁcant post-processing to pro-\\nduce coherent detections.\\nMultiGrasp. Our work is similar in design to work ongrasp detection by Redmon et al [27]. Our grid approach to\\nbounding box prediction is based on the MultiGrasp system\\nfor regression to grasps. However, grasp detection is a much\\nsimpler task than object detection. MultiGrasp only needs\\nto predict a single graspable region for an image containing\\none object. It doesn’t have to estimate the size, location,\\nor boundaries of the object or predict it’s class, only ﬁnd a\\nregion suitable for grasping. YOLO predicts both bounding\\nboxes and class probabilities for multiple objects of multi-\\nple classes in an image.\\n4. Experiments\\nFirst we compare YOLO with other real-time detection\\nsystems on P ASCAL VOC 2007. To understand the differ-\\nences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the\\nerrors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one\\nof the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based\\non the different error proﬁles we show that YOLO can be\\nused to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er-\\nrors from background false positives, giving a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and\\ncompare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally,\\nwe show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than\\nother detectors on two artwork datasets.\\n4.1. Comparison to Other Real-Time Systems\\nMany research efforts in object detection focus on mak-\\ning standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17]\\n[28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a de-\\ntection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second\\nor better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU imple-\\nmentation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz.\\nWhile the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone\\nwe also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine\\nthe accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object de-\\ntection systems.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on\\nPASCAL ; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object\\ndetector.

YOLO is\\n10 mAP more accurate than the fast version while still well above\\nreal-time in speed.\\nR-CNN, it still falls short of real-time and takes a signiﬁcant\\naccuracy hit from not having good proposals.\\nFast R-CNN speeds up the classiﬁcation stage of R-CNN\\nbut it still relies on selective search which can take around\\n2 seconds per image to generate bounding box proposals.\\nThus it has high mAP but at 0.5fps it is still far from real-\\ntime.\\nThe recent Faster R-CNN replaces selective search with\\na neural network to propose bounding boxes, similar to\\nSzegedy et al. [8] In our tests, their most accurate model\\nachieves 7 fps while a smaller, less accurate one runs at\\n18 fps. The VGG-16 version of Faster R-CNN is 10 mAP\\nhigher but is also 6 times slower than YOLO. The Zeiler-\\nFergus Faster R-CNN is only 2.5 times slower than YOLO\\nbut is also less accurate.\\n4.2. VOC 2007 Error Analysis\\nTo further examine the differences between YOLO and\\nstate-of-the-art detectors, we look at a detailed breakdown\\nof results on VOC 2007. We compare YOLO to Fast R-\\nCNN since Fast R-CNN is one of the highest performing\\ndetectors on P ASCAL and it’s detections are publicly avail-\\nable.\\nWe use the methodology and tools of Hoiem et al. [19]\\nFor each category at test time we look at the top N predic-\\ntions for that category. Each prediction is either correct or\\nit is classiﬁed based on the type of error:\\n•Correct: correct class and IOU >.5\\n•Localization: correct class, .1<IOU<.5\\n•Similar: class is similar, IOU >.1\\nCorrect: 71.6% Correct: 65.5%Loc: 8.6%Sim: 4.3%Other: 1.9%Background: 13.6%\\nLoc: 19.0%Sim: 6.75%Other: 4.0%Background: 4.75%Fast R-CNN YOLOFigure 4: Error Analysis: Fast R-CNN vs. YOLO These\\ncharts show the percentage of localization and background errors\\nin the top N detections for various categories (N = # objects in that\\ncategory).\\n•Other: class is wrong, IOU >.1\\n•Background: IOU <.1for any object\\nFigure 4 shows the breakdown of each error type aver-\\naged across all 20 classes.\\nYOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localiza-\\ntion errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other\\nsources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer local-\\nization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of\\nit’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any\\nobjects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict\\nbackground detections than YOLO.\\n4.3. Combining Fast R-CNN and YOLO\\nYOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast\\nR-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detec-\\ntions from Fast R-CNN we get a signiﬁcant boost in perfor-\\nmance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we\\ncheck to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we\\ngive that prediction a boost based on the probability pre-\\ndicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes.\\nThe best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%\\non the VOC 2007 test set.

Generalizability: Person Detection in Artwork\\nAcademic datasets for object detection draw the training\\nand testing data from the same distribution. In real-world\\napplications it is hard to predict all possible use cases andthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be-\\nfore [3]. We compare YOLO to other detection systems on\\nthe Picasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], two\\ndatasets for testing person detection on artwork.\\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between\\nYOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give\\nVOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are\\ntrained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are\\ntrained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained\\non VOC 2010.\\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN\\ndrops off considerably when applied to artwork. R-CNN\\nuses Selective Search for bounding box proposals which is\\ntuned for natural images. The classiﬁer step in R-CNN only\\nsees small regions and needs good proposals.\\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork.\\nPrior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has\\nstrong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects.\\nThough DPM doesn’t degrade as much as R-CNN, it starts\\nfrom a lower AP.\\nYOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP\\ndegrades less than other methods when applied to artwork.\\nLike DPM, YOLO models the size and shape of objects,\\nas well as relationships between objects and where objects\\ncommonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very\\ndifferent on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of\\nthe size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict\\ngood bounding boxes and detections.\\n5.
